### Book Reading

- We can compute f(1), f(2), ..., f(N) in a total of N(1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N) time.

   1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N is approximately O(log N) (Harmonic number)

### The Equation
- Count the bit from the least significant bit

  -> find the minimum possible value

- Change the bit from most significant bit

  -> find the maximum value
---

### Shifts

- Divide the shifts into 2 sets, each having the size of at most ceil(N/2)

- Sorting one vector

- Find the lower bound value of the sorted vector
